//! VM types can be passed between the host and guest via wasm linear
//! memory.
//!
//! These are either:
//! 1. Module call types
//!    The module call inputs are passed host-to-guest.
//!
//! 2. Execution environment types
//!    The environment inputs are passed guest-to-host and outputs back from
//!    host-to-guest.
